# Mapping-Visual-Cortex-in-Macaque-Cortical-Networks
MATLAB | GEPHI | STATISTICAL ANALYSIS | COMMUNITY DETECTION

Used Louvain community detection algorithm to detect multiple communities in macaque cortical network. 

Explored the similarity of one module in the cortical network and visual cortex using local statistics, spatial analysis and core-periphery.
